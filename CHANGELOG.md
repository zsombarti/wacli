## 0.1.0 - 2026-01-01

### Added

- Auth: `wacli auth` QR login, bootstrap sync, optional follow, idle-exit, background media download, contacts/groups refresh.
- Sync: non-interactive `wacli sync` once/follow, never shows QR, idle-exit, background media download, optional contacts/groups refresh.
- Messages: list/search/show/context with chat/sender/time/media filters; FTS5 search with LIKE fallback and snippets.
- Send: text and file (image/video/audio/document) with caption and MIME override.
- Media: download by chat/id, resolves output paths, and records downloaded media in the DB.
- History: on-demand backfill per chat with request count, wait, and idle-exit.
- Contacts: search/show; import from WhatsApp store; local alias and tag management.
- Chats: list/show with kind and last message timestamp.
- Groups: list/refresh/info/rename; participants add/remove/promote/demote; invite link get/revoke; join/leave.
- Diagnostics: `wacli doctor` for store path, lock status/info, auth/connection check, and FTS status.
- CLI UX: human-readable output by default with `--json`, global `--store`/`--timeout`, plus `wacli version`.
- Storage: default `~/.wacli`, lock file for single-instance safety, SQLite DB with FTS5, WhatsApp session store, and media directory.

<!-- Personal fork notes:
     - I changed the default store path to ~/Documents/wacli for easier Finder access on macOS.
     - Tracking upstream; plan to cherry-pick any 0.5.0 message search improvements.
     - I increased the default --timeout from 30s to 60s to avoid premature disconnects on slow connections.
     - I set the default message list limit from 20 to 50; I'd rather scroll than re-run with --limit.
     - I added a shell alias `wac` -> `wacli` in my dotfiles for faster typing.
